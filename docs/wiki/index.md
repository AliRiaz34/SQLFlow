# SQLFlow internals wiki

The catalog of every page in this wiki. Read this first when answering a question against the
wiki, then drill into the pages it points at.

This wiki is written and maintained by an LLM agent, not by hand. Its conventions, and the
ingest / query / lint workflows that keep it current, live in the "Internals Wiki" section of
[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). See [log.md](log.md) for the chronological record of what has been
ingested and when.

**In a hurry?** [Pattern catalog](maps/pattern-catalog.md) maps a data-engineering problem onto the
SQLFlow shape that solves it and the production flow that proves it.

## What belongs here, and what does not

This wiki explains **why SQLFlow is the way it is, how the pieces fit together, and which shape
solves which problem**. It is the synthesis layer over three raw sources: the code in `src/`, the
historical design documents under `docs/`, and the production pipeline estate.

It is not the reference manual. [docs/reference/](../reference/) documents **what** every CLI verb,
YAML key, and concept does, derived from and verified against the code. A wiki page never restates
what a reference page already says. It links to it and adds what the reference cannot carry:
rationale, rejected alternatives, cross-cutting narrative, problem-to-shape mapping, and history.

Both trees are indexed into one [manifest.json](../reference/manifest.json) by
[build_manifest.py](../reference/build_manifest.py) and embedded into the MCP server at compile time
by [tools/sqlflow-mcp/build.rs](../../tools/sqlflow-mcp/build.rs), so every page here is reachable
through `search_docs`, `get_doc`, `related_docs`, and `list_docs`. Filter by the `type` values below
to narrow a search to one kind of page.

| Directory | `type` | Answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `narratives/` | `narrative` | How do I actually do X, end to end? (code-first recipes) |
| `patterns/` | `pattern` | Which shape solves this data-engineering problem? |
| `decisions/` | `decision` | Why is it this way, and what was rejected? |
| `incidents/` | `incident` | What broke, and what generalizes from it? |
| `maps/` | `map` | Where does knowledge live, and which parts are stale? |

## Pages

### Maps

- [Pattern catalog](maps/pattern-catalog.md) - problem-first index over the 751 production
  pipelines, mapping each recurring problem to the construct that solves it. **Start here.**
- [Census drift map](maps/census-drift.md) - nine key paths the engine accepts that
  `keys.api.json` does not declare, and the enum value it documents one version behind.
- [Design document drift map](maps/design-doc-drift.md) - which documents under `docs/` describe
  shipped behavior, which are historical design intent, and where the unbannered gaps are, including
  the PowerAI retrieval design's stale "still to build" claims.

### Patterns: acquisition

- [Authenticating to a third-party API](patterns/api-authentication.md) - the five auth shapes, the
  four token-endpoint variations production forced, and why credentials are always references.
- [Walking a paged endpoint](patterns/api-pagination.md) - the five strategies, how each detects the
  end, and why a repeating cursor needs keyset instead.
- [Fetching one endpoint many times](patterns/api-fanout.md) - date windows, id lists, discovered
  ids, batching, and the retired-entity blind spot.
- [Resuming where the last run stopped](patterns/api-resume-and-watermarks.md) - the three watermark
  sources, durability across redeploys, and per-entity resume points.
- [Surviving a third-party API](patterns/api-resilience.md) - retries, rate limits, tolerating dead
  ids, and the SSRF guard the allowlist cannot widen.

### Patterns: landing and ingestion

- [Landing raw payloads verbatim](patterns/landing-and-protection.md) - why acquisition does not
  parse, how the path template partitions the lake, and the one deliberate exception for PII.
- [Turning landed files into tables](patterns/file-ingestion-shaping.md) - explode and include
  paths, CSV dialects, dating a file from its name, and pinning what inference gets wrong.
- [Incrementally ingesting a relational source](patterns/relational-incremental.md) - windows with
  overlap, chunked first loads, and narrowing at the source without changing what a filter means.
- [Upserting, keeping history, not breaking a consumer](patterns/upsert-and-history.md) - the merge
  key as the design, temporal versioning, and the compatibility view.

### Patterns: orchestration

- [Ordering a source's flows](patterns/orchestration-and-scheduling.md) - one schedule on the
  anchor, lineage waves, chaining, retiring a flow without deleting it, and the consumer registry.

### Decisions

- [Landing is string-first](decisions/string-first-landing.md) - why every non-Parquet source lands
  as strings and typing is deferred, and what the alternative would have cost.
- [A report's model entity becomes a warehouse object](decisions/powerbi-model-entity-resolution.md) -
  pattern-matching Power Query instead of parsing it, reusing the synonym pass instead of adding a
  mechanism, and why an unresolvable source is reported rather than guessed.
- [The semantic layer is the column allow-list](decisions/semantic-layer-is-the-allow-list.md) - one
  estate-wide layer instead of named contexts, removing raw schema tools from the chat instead of filtering the
  shared endpoints, and the no-tracking update bug building it exposed.
- [A Power BI report travels as its specification](decisions/powerbi-report-specifications.md) - why the
  extractor stayed put while its output moved into committed files and the semantic layer, why uploads are read by
  an isolated service, and the silent model loss on control plane syncs that forced it.
- [An external database is registered by a flow, and the dashboard supplies the model](decisions/schema-registration-flows.md) -
  why `flowType: sch` exists instead of reusing scm, why it reads only tables and views and leaves joins and
  measures to the dashboard, and why subscribers link to it by name.
- [A report visual's query is translated into T-SQL at sync, or refused with a reason](decisions/visual-sql-translation.md) -
  why the output is T-SQL only, why a stated Power Query and DAX subset refuses rather than approximates, why it
  runs in the graph builder, and why the translation is served as a dashboard match's SQL.

### Incidents

- [A misspelled or misplaced YAML key does nothing](incidents/ignored-yaml-keys.md) - unmatched
  properties are silently dropped; a live production flow configures a retry knob that is not real.
- [A report saved by a current PowerBI Desktop extracted with no visuals](incidents/pbix-split-report-format.md) -
  the vendor replaced one report part with a tree of per-visual documents, the loss showed up as a
  smaller number rather than an error, and a shared error message named the wrong cause.

### Narratives: recipes

Code-first, end-to-end. Each one is a runnable shape with generic table and column names.

- [How flows chain through the lake](narratives/chaining-flows-through-the-lake.md) - the two joints
  that compose every pipeline, and how lineage derives the waves from them. **Read this first.**
- [Connecting any source](narratives/recipe-connect-any-source.md) - every integration in one table:
  which flow kind fetches it, the minimum YAML, and the rule when two kinds could both work.
- [A REST API into the warehouse](narratives/recipe-api-source.md) - the three files, the schedule
  that fires them in order, and the commands to verify each stage.
- [Vendor files into the warehouse](narratives/recipe-vendor-file-source.md) - an SFTP drop or a
  `cpy` bridge, the `output` block lineage needs, and one file feeding several tables.
- [Another database into the warehouse](narratives/recipe-database-source.md) - browse, scaffold,
  then split the first load from the daily delta.
- [Choosing an incremental load](narratives/recipe-incremental-load.md) - a decision tree, and the
  two ways an incremental silently does nothing.
- [Staging to silver](narratives/recipe-staging-to-silver.md) - the typed view is the contract:
  writing it, keeping a rebuilt table's old shape, and running two eras behind one name.
- [Building a dimension and its surrogate keys](narratives/recipe-dimension-and-surrogate-keys.md) -
  minting keys in a key table, projecting into `edw`, and the snapshot trap that truncates history.
- [Several regions into one table](narratives/recipe-fan-in-shared-target.md) - the discriminator in
  the merge key and the scoped probe that stops the writers starving each other.
- [Backfilling and replaying](narratives/recipe-backfill-and-replay.md) - the flags that reach past a
  watermark, and why a backfilled table stays invisible to the flow above it.
- [Getting data back out](narratives/recipe-export-and-deliver.md) - `exp` to files, `trl` to
  documents, `inv` to another system, and the subscriber registry that answers "what breaks".
- [Noticing a wrong-but-successful run](narratives/recipe-quality-and-monitoring.md) - anomaly checks
  and the plain SQL assertions a model will not write for you.
- [Seeing what a flow will do](narratives/recipe-inspect-and-debug.md) - the read-only ladder, and
  the ordered checklist when a flow loads nothing.

[docs/flattener-memory-postmortem.md](../flattener-memory-postmortem.md) is an existing postmortem
that has not been ingested into this wiki.

## Coverage

Seeded 2026-09-09 with the structure, the lint tool, and the pattern catalog harvested from the
production estate. The pattern pages cover the constructs that estate actually exercises; a
construct SQLFlow supports but nothing in production uses may have no page yet. Absence of a page
means the topic has not been ingested, never that it is out of scope.
