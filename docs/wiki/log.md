# Wiki log

Append-only, chronological. Newest entries go at the bottom. Every entry starts with the same
prefix so the log stays greppable:

```
grep "^## \[" docs/wiki/log.md | tail -5
```

Entry format, enforced by [lint_wiki.py](lint_wiki.py):

```

## [2026-09-09] ingest | Wiki instantiated from the Karpathy LLM wiki pattern

Source: Karpathy's `llm-wiki` gist (https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f).

Established the three-layer split for this repository: raw sources are `src/`, the historical
design documents under `docs/`, and the git history; the wiki is `docs/wiki/`; the schema is the
"Internals Wiki" section of `CLAUDE.md`. Chose `index.md` as the only navigational surface rather
than a second `manifest.json`, so `docs/reference/build_manifest.py` stays the single manifest
builder and the MCP corpus stays purely code-verified.

Created `index.md`, `log.md`, `lint_wiki.py`, and the `narratives/ decisions/ incidents/ maps/`
taxonomy.

## [2026-09-09] ingest | Design documents under docs/ and their drift banners

Sources: the nine documents directly under `docs/`, read for their drift banners and status.

Wrote [maps/design-doc-drift.md](maps/design-doc-drift.md). Finding worth surfacing: `flowType: api`
has a key census (`docs/reference/flow/keys.api.json`) but no reference prose page, so the
unbannered `docs/acquisition.md` is the only prose describing it and is load-bearing rather than
historical. Every other design document under `docs/` carries an explicit banner deferring to
`docs/reference/`.

## [2026-09-09] ingest | String-first landing as a deliberate decision

Sources: `docs/reference/concepts/type-inference.md`, `docs/reference/concepts/pre-ingestion-transform.md`.

Wrote [decisions/string-first-landing.md](decisions/string-first-landing.md), recording the
rationale, the Parquet exception, and the downstream consequence that a ported predicate written
against a legacy empty-string convention silently changes meaning.

## [2026-09-09] ingest | Production pattern estate (dwh-pipelines-prod)

Source: the production pipeline repository, 751 flow documents across 39 source folders, harvested
structurally rather than sampled (669 distinct key paths, 0 parse errors).

Wrote the ten pattern pages and [maps/pattern-catalog.md](maps/pattern-catalog.md), which indexes a
data-engineering problem onto the SQLFlow shape that solves it and the production folder that proves
it. Frequencies quoted on the pattern pages are counts from that harvest.

Two findings came out of verifying production keys against the source tree rather than trusting the
YAML: [maps/census-drift.md](maps/census-drift.md) records nine key paths the engine accepts that the
api key census does not declare (plus the `incremental.source: sql` enum value), and
[incidents/ignored-yaml-keys.md](incidents/ignored-yaml-keys.md) records a live production flow
configuring `retry.backoffSeconds`, which exists nowhere in the engine and is silently ignored.

## [2026-09-09] lint | Wiki wired into the MCP corpus

Reversed the earlier decision to keep the wiki out of the indexed corpus: it is now embedded and
searchable alongside the reference pages. `build_manifest.py` scans both trees into one
`manifest.json`, each entry carrying a `corpus` field naming which root its path is relative to;
`tools/sqlflow-mcp/build.rs` resolves the two roots when embedding bodies. `docs.rs` needed no change
because serde ignores unknown manifest fields. The `.dockerignore` and `Dockerfile.mcp` now carry
`docs/wiki` into the image context, without which the container build would have failed on a path
that does not exist.

Added the `pattern` page type to the lint and to the manifest builder's type validation, which now
also reports a page whose type belongs to the other corpus.

## [2026-09-10] ingest | Composition grammar from the lineage graph

Source: `sqlflow lineage` over the production estate (708 flows, 1,495 objects, 2,175 edges, 282 flow
dependencies, 4 waves), rather than inference from the YAML.

The graph settled how flows actually compose. There is no `dependsOn`: flows are joined by naming the
same artifact, and exactly two joints do all the work. A lake path binds every file producer (`api`,
`cpy`, `sftp`) to every file consumer, with `abfss://`, `https://` and `az://` normalized to one
canonical key, which is why a producer and consumer written in different URI forms still bind. The
pre view binds a file flow to its `ing` flow, named `v_` + the file flow's `target.table`.

Measured hand-offs: `cpy`->`file` 96, `api`->`file` 40, `sftp`->`file` 6, `sftp`->`cpy` 1,
`cpy`->`cpy` 2, `file`->`ing` 124, `ing`->`ing` 13. Written up in
[narratives/chaining-flows-through-the-lake.md](narratives/chaining-flows-through-the-lake.md).

Two things the graph made visible that the YAML alone did not: `sftp` flows need an explicit `output`
block or the graph has a hole where the data enters, and `sp` flows contribute no edges without
`--connect`, so a chain running through one looks broken when it is not.

## [2026-09-10] ingest | Twelve code-first recipes

Populated `narratives/` as runnable recipes rather than prose: connecting any source, the three
end-to-end source shapes (api, vendor files, database), incremental load, staging to silver,
dimensions and surrogate keys, fan-in to a shared target, backfill and replay, export and delivery,
quality monitoring, and inspect/debug.

All examples use generic table and column names so a recipe reads as a reusable shape rather than as
estate documentation; production provenance stays in the pattern pages' exemplar tables.

Two areas were added beyond what was asked, because the estate exercises them and nothing covered
them: getting data back out (`exp`, `trl`, `inv`, plus the `subscribers` registry that answers what
breaks), and noticing a run that succeeds while being wrong.

Findings recorded along the way: `incremental.columns` silently ignores `overlapDays`, because only
an `IsDate` mark receives the `DATEADD`, so the rewind that shape actually has is `lookback`. And a
fan-in to one target starves every writer but the furthest ahead unless each scopes its probe with
`source.incrementalClause`; total row count keeps growing throughout, so only per-discriminator
counts reveal it.

The lint's `sourceRefs` tripwire caught two invented paths in this pass before they shipped.

## [2026-09-13] ingest | PowerBI model-entity resolution

Ingested the model-entity resolution work landed in `tools/pbix-extract` and `SqlFlow.Lineage`,
alongside its design document (`docs/powerai-model-entity-resolution-design.md`) and the roadmap in
`POWERAI.md`.

One new decision page: why the Power Query expression is pattern-matched in the C tool rather than
parsed, why the resulting mapping is emitted as an ordinary `SynonymLink` instead of a new graph
mechanism, and why the M-literal server is reported but never used as an estate identity.

The page records two departures from its own design document, since both are the kind of thing that
looks like an oversight later: the proposed `modelSourceServer` subscriber key was not built (the
implementation removed the need for it by never comparing the two server identities), and native
`[Query="..."]` sources are refused rather than re-parsed, because resolving them would mean a second
T-SQL parser inside the C tool.

Also recorded, because it is the honest state rather than the intended one: only the refusal path has
run end to end. Every table in the one sample report is Excel- or JSON-backed, and the C# test fixture
cannot synthesize a model source, so the resolved path is proven by the tool's own unit checks and by
the existing synonym mechanism, not by a test spanning the seam between them.

`docs/reference/flow/subscribers.md` gained the table node's new `source*` properties and a section on
what resolves and what does not; that is reference material (what the surface does), so it lives there
rather than here.

## [2026-09-13] ingest | Proving model-entity resolution, and the report format that changed underneath it

Source: a working session repointing `samples/powerbi/AdventureWorks Sales.pbix` from its original
Excel workbook onto the restored AdventureWorksDW2022 database, plus the `tools/pbix-extract` change
that came out of it.

The decision page on model-entity resolution had a "What is still unproven" section saying only the
refusal path had ever run against a real file. That is now half closed and the page says so precisely:
all seven SQL-backed tables resolve to real `dbo.*` warehouse objects, the `Json.Document` helper table
is still correctly refused in the same report, and the remaining gap is the control-plane half
(`FlowSetCollector` to `SynonymLink` to `LineageGraphBuilder`), against which no `db sync` has run.
Narrowing the claim rather than deleting it matters here, because the chain stops halfway and the
rendered SQL still being in model terms is easy to misread as a failure when it is correct at that
layer.

The page also now records two things about the repointing that a later reader would otherwise take for
mistakes: the `Customer`-to-`Sales` relationship was dropped because `FactResellerSales` genuinely has
no `CustomerKey`, and rebuilding tables under new queries cost the model a calculated column and two
visuals' field bindings.

One new incident page: extracting the re-saved report returned zero pages and zero visuals, because
Power BI Desktop now writes the visual layer as `Report/definition/...`, one document per page and per
visual, instead of a single `Report/Layout`. What generalizes is the shape of the failure rather than
the format detail. The loss arrived as a smaller number instead of an error, below the layer where the
tool's refusal discipline operates; the shared "member not found" message explained it as a missing
model, a cause that fit only the caller it was written for; and the expression vocabulary turned out to
be unchanged, so the fix was a translation of structure rather than a second implementation.

Both report shapes must stay supported, and the sample having been re-saved means the real file now
exercises the new reader while synthetic fixtures hold the old one, exactly reversing which path had
real coverage the day before.

## [2026-09-13] ingest | Two bugs found by running model-entity resolution end to end

Source: a `db sync --connect` against the repointed sample report, and the two fixes it forced.

The decision page's "What is still unproven" section had just been narrowed to "only the extractor
half". Running the other half showed the claim was too generous in the other direction: the chain had
never worked at all, and the extractor half only looked proven because the check that seemed to prove
it (grepping the emitted YAML for `sourceName`) cannot see the defect.

Two bugs, one on each side of the seam. The C tool wrote every table's `source*` properties onto the
last column node instead of its own table node, because the YAML is a stream and the sources were
written in a later pass. The graph builder registered a model entity's synonym as a one-part name with
no database, while the default-database pass filled the connection's catalog into exactly those facts
first, so the two identities never met for any connection string that names a database.

The page now records both, and what generalizes from them: each half was individually tested and
individually correct-looking, the defect lived in the agreement between them, and a seam between two
languages is where no unit test reaches. "The values are right" turned out to be a different claim
from "the consumer can read them".

Both POWERAI.md Section 10 and this page previously said the extractor half was proven; both are
corrected rather than quietly amended, since the earlier claim is exactly the kind a later reader
would otherwise rely on.

## [2026-09-15] ingest | The semantic layer is the column allow-list

Wrote [The semantic layer is the column allow-list](decisions/semantic-layer-is-the-allow-list.md) from the
semantic layer implementation (`SemanticLayer.cs`, its read and admin endpoint files, the chat tool allowlist in
`AssistantSettings.cs`) and the two design decisions the human made while it was built: the allow-list as the
layer's only membership, and the chat assistants losing the raw schema tools rather than the shared endpoints
being filtered. It also records the no-tracking update bug the new integration tests exposed in the column policy
upsert. The surface itself is documented in the reference page `concept-semantic-layer`.

## [2026-09-15] ingest | The assistant surface closes the text leaks

Extended [The semantic layer is the column allow-list](decisions/semantic-layer-is-the-allow-list.md) with why the
chat's operational tools and its two data-operations tasks are narrowed by an advisory `surface=assistant` marker
(`AssistantScope.cs`, `control_plane.rs`) rather than removed, given a separate token, or redacted for everyone.
The mechanism is documented in the reference page `concept-semantic-layer`.

## [2026-09-15] ingest | PowerAI retrieval design drift

Mapped [docs/powerai-question-retrieval-design.md](../powerai-question-retrieval-design.md) into the
[design document drift map](maps/design-doc-drift.md). Its status line, Section 7, and Section 8 step 6
still describe the confirmed-example table and the GUI confirmation row as unbuilt; the code shows both
(`CatalogQuestionExample`, `AnswerConfirmation.tsx`), plus the admin Saved answers page added the same
day. The raw document is left as written. The map now links the semantic layer decision page, which had
no inbound `related` link.

## [2026-09-15] ingest | Saved answers and Power BI models join the semantic layer

Extended [The semantic layer is the column allow-list](decisions/semantic-layer-is-the-allow-list.md) with two
decisions the human made: the saved answers are stored in the semantic layer (`QuestionExample` renamed to
`SemanticExample` by a hand-written rename migration, curation moved to the Semantic layer page, the confirm and
auto-run routes kept), and a Power BI report's model is served on the warehouse table each model table loads from
(`describe_semantic_table`'s `reportModels`), graded against the column allow-list, rather than imported as curated
annotations or served ungraded. The surfaces are documented in `concept-semantic-layer` and `flow-subscribers`.

## [2026-09-16] ingest | Power BI report specifications move into the semantic layer

Wrote [A Power BI report travels as its specification](decisions/powerbi-report-specifications.md) from the
human's question of whether `pbix-extract` should move into the semantic layer, and the design settled with them:
the tool stays, its specification becomes the stored and shipped unit (`ReportSpecs.cs`, `CatalogSemanticReportSpec`,
the `AddSemanticReportSpecs` migration), GUI uploads are read by the isolated `SqlFlow.PbixExtractor` service, and
`sqlflow powerbi extract|publish` serves report owners without a C toolchain. It records the defect that forced the
change (the managed sync erasing a model a developer sync had written) and the subscriber-library fingerprint that
closed a second gap found on the way. The surfaces are documented in `flow-subscribers`, `concept-semantic-layer`,
and `cli-control-plane`.
