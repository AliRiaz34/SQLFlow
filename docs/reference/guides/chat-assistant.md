# The GUI chat assistant

The workbench's Assistant page (`/chat`) is a ChatGPT-style chat over the SQLFlow estate: ask "what failed last night?", "what feeds `dbo.Orders`?", or "why is this table short?", and the answer streams in, grounded in the live catalog and the reference docs through the same SQLFlow MCP server the Slack assistant uses. Paste a screenshot to ask about it, or press the microphone and ask out loud; the recording is transcribed server-side and lands in the composer as text.

## One assistant, two surfaces

The Slack bot and the GUI chat share one implementation: `SqlFlow.Assistant`, the provider gateways (Azure AI Foundry / OpenAI over the Responses API, Anthropic over the Messages API's MCP connector) and one instructions document. Only the surface differs: Slack answers are formatted as mrkdwn and posted once; GUI answers are GitHub-flavored Markdown streamed token by token, with live tool-call activity shown in the thread. Switching providers or updating the assistant's knowledge changes both surfaces at once.

## Per-user authority (the difference from Slack)

The Slack bot holds one shared read-scoped token, because everyone in a channel shares the bot's identity. The GUI chat has a signed-in user on every request, so the control plane forwards the caller's OWN bearer to the MCP server on every agent run: the assistant can read exactly what that user can read, and the control plane enforces the token's scopes per tool call exactly as it would for the user's own API calls. The tool allowlist still defaults to the read-only surface (`ControlPlane:Assistant:Mcp:AllowedTools`).

## The chain

```
GUI /chat -> control plane POST /api/v1/chat/ask (SSE stream)
          -> SqlFlow.Assistant gateway (Foundry / OpenAI / Anthropic)
          -> sqlflow-mcp over streamable HTTP (the tools, caller's bearer)
          -> control plane /api/v1 (bearer-scoped)
```

Conversations persist in the catalog (`ChatConversation` / `ChatMessage`): the transcript is the durable record, provider-side conversation state is only a cache of it, so a control-plane restart or a re-opened browser loses nothing. Deleting a conversation deletes its messages; conversations are strictly per-user.

## Links in answers

Answers are navigational: when the assistant names a table, flow, run, schedule, or report, it links the name to that thing's page in the workbench, and a table also gets a link to its lineage graph. The links are not composed by the model. Every online MCP tool result carries a `links` object on each row, built by the MCP server from the identity the row already had:

| Row | `links` |
| --- | --- |
| a warehouse object | `page` (its catalog page), `lineage` (the graph focused on it) |
| a flow | `page` (`/pipelines/<id>`), `lineage` (the graph focused on it, scoped to its repo) |
| a run | `page` (`/runs/<id>`), `flow`, `runGroup` |
| a schedule | `page` (its runs board, filtered to it) |
| a subscriber (report/dashboard) | `page` (`/subscribers?key=...`); its own `url` still points at the report itself |
| a lineage step, edge, or search hit | `object`, `objectLineage`, `flow`, `run` for whatever it references |

Rows are recognised by the identity fields they carry rather than by the tool that returned them, so the same shape links identically wherever it appears, and a tool added later is linked without being wired up.

`SQLFLOW_GUI_URL` on the MCP server decides the form: set it to the GUI's public base URL and the links are absolute, which is what Slack and any client rendering outside the GUI need. Left unset they are root-relative (`/catalog?node=...`), which resolves for the GUI chat and nowhere else. `main.bicep` sets it from the deployed GUI automatically.

## Confirming an answer

Under every finished answer that hands back a SQL query, the thread shows one row: **Yes**, **Not quite**, **No**. This is the confirmation moment of PowerAI's learning loop, and it is what turns an answer a person checked into precedent the next similar question is matched against.

- **Yes** opens the query read-only for a last look, with an optional datasource picker, and stores it as a confirmed example.
- **Not quite** opens the same query in an editable SQL editor. What is stored is the CORRECTED query, never the original proposal, so the example the estate learns from is the one that actually worked.
- **No** records the decision and stores nothing. Only correct, verified answers become precedent, so a refuted query is discarded rather than kept as a "do not propose this again" row.

The query being judged is read from the answer's own ```sql fenced blocks, which is exactly what the person read before deciding; an answer carrying several queries gets a numbered picker. Only `sql`-tagged fences count, since an untagged one is as likely to be YAML or a table of results. The question is the user turn the answer replies to, so an answer confirmed from a re-opened conversation records the same pair a live one would.

The datasource is optional and must be a whole `${env:...}` / `${keyvault:...}` reference or an `@alias` that the catalog already declares. Without one, the confirm endpoint stores the datasource the query's objects live on (from the object keys when supplied, whose first segment is the connection reference, otherwise from the tables the SQL reads), and leaves it empty only when those do not point at exactly one declared datasource.

The row posts to `POST /api/v1/powerai/questions/confirm`, the same endpoint behind the `confirm_question` MCP tool, so a click and a tool call land the same row and nothing new is stored on this path. It appears only when the deployment has the example store turned on: `GET /api/v1/chat/capabilities` reports `questionConfirmation`, which is `ControlPlane:PowerAI:Retrieval:Enabled` read from the same options the confirm endpoint answers 501 on. Confirming the same question and query again refreshes the existing example rather than adding a duplicate, so reaffirming an answer does not give it extra weight in later searches.

## Running a query

Every finished `sql`-fenced block in the thread carries a Run (play) button in its own toolbar row, beside the format/copy buttons `CodeView` already draws. Clicking it runs the query through the *same* two-step DataOps path (`docs/reference/concepts/data-operations.md`, "Running a query from the chat GUI") `prepare_query`/`run_query` use over MCP: prepare mints a token, run redeems it. The SQL is already fully visible in the block, so the click itself is the person's approval; there is no second confirmation dialog, matching how a confirmed example needs no re-approval before `auto_run_trusted_match`.

The click names no datasource: the control plane works it out from the tables the query reads (`DatasourceInference`, the same resolver retrieval, confirmation and auto-run use). Only when it cannot tell, because none of the tables is on a datasource the estate declares or they exist on several, does prepare answer 422 and a picker (filtered to datasources the estate can actually reach) appear with that explanation. The result renders as a fitting chart, never a fixed one: a single row of one to four numbers becomes stat tiles, one category column against one measure becomes a bar chart, a date column against up to four measures becomes a line chart (splitting into small multiples rather than sharing an axis when those measures' scales are far apart, since a shared axis would flatten the smaller one to the floor), and any other shape falls back to a table. A Chart/Table toggle is always available next to a rendered chart. `gui/src/features/chat/SqlRunPanel.tsx` owns the run state; `QueryResultView.tsx` is the classifier and renderer.

## Business questions (`!cwd`)

A `!cwd` question is answered for a business reader: the answer opens with the plain finding in a sentence or two, without retrieval scores, matched terms, datasource references or tool names. A trusted confirmed match (`find_similar_questions` reports `trusted`, and the match carries an `exampleId`) is run immediately with `auto_run_trusted_match`, with no approval prompt and no datasource question; `auto_run_trusted_match` is on the GUI's default tool allowlist for exactly this. A match is trusted when it clears `RankThreshold` or is the same question as the one typed (the same meaningful words once stop words and plural or verb endings are ignored), so a short question's verbatim twin is not refused for having only one word to count.

When a query actually ran, the answer carries a fenced `query-result` block holding the run's compute task id. `QueryResultEmbed.tsx` renders it by reading the stored task (`GET /api/v1/datasources/tasks/{id}`), as the same chart or table the Run button shows, so nothing executes again and a re-opened conversation shows the same result. The SQL behind the answer follows in a `sql` block, which keeps the Run button and the confirmation row available on it.

The affordance is gated by `dataOpsRunQuery` on `GET /api/v1/chat/capabilities` (`ControlPlane:DataOps:Enabled`, the same switch `prepare_query`/`run_query` answer 403 on), so it is absent, not merely disabled, on a deployment without the data-operations surface turned on.

## Voice input

Two modes, picked automatically:

- **Server-side transcription** (preferred): when a transcription deployment is configured (`ControlPlane:Assistant:Foundry:TranscriptionDeploymentName`, or `OpenAI:TranscriptionModel` in OpenAI mode), the mic records in the browser and `POST /api/v1/chat/transcribe` turns the recording into text via the provider's `/audio/transcriptions` endpoint, using the same managed identity / API key as the answers.
- **Browser speech recognition** (fallback): without a transcription model, the mic uses the browser's built-in speech recognition where available.

## Configuration

The feature is off by default and reports itself through `GET /api/v1/chat/capabilities`, so a GUI on an estate without AI simply explains that instead of erroring. Enable it with `ControlPlane:Assistant:*`:

- `Enabled=true`
- `Provider`: `AzureFoundry` (default, managed identity, no key), `OpenAI`, or `Anthropic`
- `Foundry:ProjectEndpoint` + `Foundry:ModelDeploymentName` (AzureFoundry mode)
- `Mcp:ServerUrl`: the deployed SQLFlow MCP endpoint
- optional: `Foundry:TranscriptionDeploymentName`, `MaxImages`, `MaxImageBytes`, `RunTimeoutSeconds`
- key-based modes: `OpenAI:ApiKey` / `Anthropic:ApiKey` accept `${env:...}`/`${keyvault:...}` references

In the Bicep estate this wires itself: once `aiFoundryName` + `aiFoundryModelName` and `mcpImage` are set (the same inputs the Slack assistant needs), `main.bicep` enables the chat on the control plane, points it at the estate's Foundry project and MCP server, and grants the control-plane identity the Cognitive Services OpenAI User role. Set `aiFoundryTranscriptionModelName` (for example `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`) to deploy the audio model and light up server-side voice input.
