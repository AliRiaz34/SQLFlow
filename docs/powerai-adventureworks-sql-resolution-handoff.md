# Handoff: repoint the sample .pbix at SQL Server to prove model-entity resolution

Status: **DONE, for the extractor half.** Carried out on a Windows machine with PowerBI Desktop on
2026-09-13. The steps below are kept as the record of what was done and why, with the outcome of each
noted. What the repointing proved, and the one part of the chain it did not reach, is recorded in
POWERAI.md Section 10 and in
[docs/wiki/decisions/powerbi-model-entity-resolution.md](wiki/decisions/powerbi-model-entity-resolution.md).

## Outcome

All seven SQL-backed model tables resolve to real warehouse objects (`Customer` to `dbo.DimCustomer`,
`Date` to `dbo.DimDate`, `Product` to `dbo.DimProduct`, `Reseller` to `dbo.DimReseller`, `Sales` and
`Sales Order` to `dbo.FactResellerSales`, `Sales Territory` to `dbo.DimSalesTerritory`), each carrying
`sourceServer`/`sourceDatabase`/`sourceSchema`/`sourceName`. The `Table` helper stays
`Json.Document`-sourced and is still correctly refused, so the one report now exercises both the
resolved and the refusal path. The evidence is committed as
`samples/powerbi/AdventureWorks_Sales.spec.yaml`; the `.pbix` itself remains gitignored.

Four things were learned or fixed along the way that the plan below did not anticipate:

- **Power BI Desktop saved the report in the newer split `Report/definition` format**, which
  `tools/pbix-extract` could not read at all, so the first extraction returned zero pages and zero
  visuals. The tool now reads both formats. See
  [docs/wiki/incidents/pbix-split-report-format.md](wiki/incidents/pbix-split-report-format.md).
- **Rebuilding each table as a new query cost the model everything bound to the old tables**: the
  `Sales Amount by Due Date` measure and a `Sorting` calculated column were deleted with them, and a
  slicer and an area chart lost their field bindings. The measure was restored by hand; the rest was
  left, since the visual layer was not what this exercise set out to prove. Editing each existing
  query's `Source` step in place would have avoided this, and is the better route if it is ever done
  again.
- **PowerBI's SQL Server connector would not connect to `localhost,14333`**, failing with a Named
  Pipes error; `127.0.0.1,14333` connects, because a host name of `localhost` sends the client down a
  protocol that the container does not serve.
- **Every `.sh` in the repo was checked out with CRLF line endings** on Windows, which broke
  `adventureworks-restore.sh` the moment it was bind-mounted into a Linux container. Fixed repo-wide
  with a `.gitattributes` rule.

## The remaining gap

No `db sync` has been run against the repointed report, so the control-plane half of the chain
(`FlowSetCollector` turning the source fields into a `SynonymLink`, `LineageGraphBuilder` rewriting
the model name onto the node an ingestion flow writes) is still exercised only by its own tests. The
rendered SQL in the spec is therefore still in model terms (`FROM [Sales] AS [Sales]`), which is
correct at the extractor layer: the rewrite happens downstream. Step 5 below is the step not yet done.

## The original plan, as written before the work

Everything below is the plan as it stood beforehand.

## Why this exists

POWERAI.md Section 10's "Known limitations" says model-entity-to-warehouse-object resolution is
built and unit-tested, but never proven end to end, because the only sample report on file
(`samples/powerbi/AdventureWorks Sales.pbix`) has every table sourced via `Excel.Workbook` or
`Json.Document`, neither of which `tools/pbix-extract`'s resolver (`src/msource.c`) recognizes. Only
the refusal path (a table correctly reported as unresolved) has ever been exercised against a real
report; the resolved path has only 27 unit tests, no live proof.

This was confirmed directly in a manual test session: syncing the sample report produced warnings
like `model table 'Sales' is sourced via Excel.Workbook, which names no warehouse object`, for every
one of its 8 tables, and the rendered SQL for every visual came back with model/DAX-style names
(`FROM [Sales] AS [s]`, `[s].[Sales Amount by Due Date]`) rather than resolved warehouse identifiers.

## What is already done (Linux side, verified)

A real SQL Server database now exists with the exact dimensional shape this report's model expects:
Microsoft's official **AdventureWorksDW2022** sample (the data-warehouse edition: `DimCustomer`,
`DimProduct`, `DimReseller`, `DimDate`, `DimSalesTerritory`, `FactResellerSales`, ...), restored as
database `AdventureWorks`.

- `deploy/docker/adventureworks-restore.sh`: downloads the official `.bak` from
  `github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples` and restores it, idempotently (skips once the database
  exists).
- `deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml`: a new `adventureworks-init` one-shot service runs that script
  against the stack's `mssql` service on `docker compose up`.
- Verified live, twice: a fresh restore (12,242 pages, ~26 dimensional/fact tables) and a re-run that
  correctly skipped. Column names for every table this report's model needs were read directly from
  the restored database (below).

**AdventureWorksLT2022 (the OLTP/normalized edition) was tried first and rejected**: its schema
(`SalesLT.Customer`, `SalesLT.Product`, `SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader`, ...) is transactional, not
dimensional, and has no `Reseller`, no `Sales Territory`, no denormalized `Sales` fact, so nothing in
it matches this report's model despite the shared "AdventureWorks" name.

## What is NOT done: the .pbix's Power Query still reads Excel

Repointing the database does nothing by itself. The `.pbix` file's model still names
`Excel.Workbook(File.Contents("..."), ...)` as every table's source; that M expression lives inside
the compressed, binary `DataModel` part of the `.pbix` (an XPress9-encoded ABF container with an
embedded SQLite catalog), not as editable plain text. `tools/pbix-extract` only reads that format;
nothing in this repo writes it. The only faithful way to change it is PowerBI Desktop, which is
Windows-only.

## Steps to do on a Windows machine with PowerBI Desktop

1. Bring up the compose stack (or otherwise get `AdventureWorksDW2022` reachable from the Windows
   machine): `docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml up -d mssql adventureworks-init`.
   Confirm the `AdventureWorks` database exists and has data (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
   dbo.FactResellerSales` should return a large number).
2. Open `samples/powerbi/AdventureWorks Sales.pbix` in PowerBI Desktop.
3. Open **Transform data** (Power Query Editor). For each of the 8 tables, replace its `Source` step
   with `Sql.Database("<host>", "AdventureWorks")` and select the matching table below instead of the
   Excel sheet reference. Use **Table.SelectColumns** (or just select the fewer/renamed columns
   directly in the query editor) to keep only the columns the model actually uses, renamed to match
   what the model's existing column names expect — the DW schema uses different column names than
   the Excel export did, so a rename step per table is required, not just a source swap.

   | Report table | New source | Column rename (Excel name → DW column) |
   |---|---|---|
   | `Customer` | `dbo.DimCustomer` | `CustomerKey`→`CustomerKey`, `Customer ID`→`CustomerAlternateKey`, `Customer`→ concat of `FirstName`+`LastName` (or `EnglishOccupation` if a closer analog is wanted — there is no single "Customer" display name column; a computed column is needed), `City`/`State-Province`/`Country-Region`/`Postal Code`→ join to `DimGeography` via `GeographyKey` (DW normalizes geography out of `DimCustomer`) |
   | `Date` | `dbo.DimDate` | `DateKey`→`DateKey`, `Date`→`FullDateAlternateKey`, `Fiscal Year`→`FiscalYear`, `Fiscal Quarter`→`FiscalQuarter`, `Month`→`EnglishMonthName` (or derive from `FullDateAlternateKey`), `Full Date`→`FullDateAlternateKey`, `MonthKey`→ derive from `CalendarYear`*100+`MonthNumberOfYear` (DW has no single MonthKey column) |
   | `Product` | `dbo.DimProduct` (join `dbo.DimProductSubcategory`, `dbo.DimProductCategory`) | `ProductKey`→`ProductKey`, `SKU`→`ProductAlternateKey`, `Product`→`EnglishProductName`, `Standard Cost`→`StandardCost`, `Color`→`Color`, `List Price`→`ListPrice`, `Model`→`ModelName`, `Subcategory`→`DimProductSubcategory.EnglishProductSubcategoryName`, `Category`→`DimProductCategory.EnglishProductCategoryName` |
   | `Reseller` | `dbo.DimReseller` | `ResellerKey`→`ResellerKey`, `Reseller ID`→`ResellerAlternateKey`, `Business Type`→`BusinessType`, `Reseller`→`ResellerName`, `City`/`State-Province`/`Country-Region`/`Postal Code`→ join to `DimGeography` via `GeographyKey` |
   | `Sales` | `dbo.FactResellerSales` | `SalesOrderLineKey`→ composite of `SalesOrderNumber`+`SalesOrderLineNumber` (DW has no single surrogate line key), `ResellerKey`→`ResellerKey`, `CustomerKey`→ N/A (FactResellerSales has no CustomerKey; it is reseller-channel only — drop or repoint the report's Customer relationship to go through Reseller/Geography instead), `ProductKey`→`ProductKey`, `OrderDateKey`→`OrderDateKey`, `DueDateKey`→`DueDateKey`, `ShipDateKey`→`ShipDateKey`, `SalesTerritoryKey`→`SalesTerritoryKey`, `Order Quantity`→`OrderQuantity`, `Unit Price`→`UnitPrice`, `Extended Amount`→`ExtendedAmount`, `Unit Price Discount Pct`→`UnitPriceDiscountPct`, `Product Standard Cost`→`ProductStandardCost`, `Total Product Cost`→`TotalProductCost`, `Sales Amount`→`SalesAmount` |
   | `Sales Order` | `dbo.FactResellerSales` (distinct `SalesOrderNumber`/`SalesOrderLineNumber`) | `SalesOrderLineKey`→ composite key as above, `Sales Order`→`SalesOrderNumber`, `Sales Order Line`→`SalesOrderLineNumber`, `Channel`→ literal `"Reseller"` (DW has no Channel column; this report's Channel concept does not exist in FactResellerSales, which is reseller-only — consider dropping this column) |
   | `Sales Territory` | `dbo.DimSalesTerritory` | `SalesTerritoryKey`→`SalesTerritoryKey`, `Region`→`SalesTerritoryRegion`, `Country`→`SalesTerritoryCountry`, `Group`→`SalesTerritoryGroup` |
   | `Table` (the small Category/Sorting helper table) | leave as-is (`Json.Document`) | This table is report-local metadata (a sort-order helper for Product Category), not a warehouse concept; it has no DW equivalent and does not need to move. |

   **The `Customer`/`Sales` mismatch is the one real modeling problem**, not just a rename: DW's
   `FactResellerSales` has no `CustomerKey` at all (this DW ships reseller-channel sales only; retail
   customer sales live in the separate `FactInternetSales` against `DimCustomer`, an unrelated fact).
   The report's current model treats `Customer` and `Reseller` as siblings both hanging off `Sales`.
   The faithful DW equivalent is to drop the `Customer`↔`Sales` relationship (or repoint the
   `Customer` table to `FactInternetSales` and accept it becomes an independent, unrelated table in
   this report, which changes what the model can join). Decide this explicitly rather than silently
   dropping rows; either choice is a real modeling call, not a mechanical rename.

4. Save the file (**File > Save**, keep it as `AdventureWorks Sales.pbix` or save a new copy such as
   `AdventureWorks Sales (SQL).pbix` if you want to keep the Excel-sourced original for comparison in
   the estate).
5. Copy the changed `.pbix` back to this repo (or hand it to me directly) and I'll re-run the same
   sync used in the earlier manual test:
   ```
   sqlflow db sync . --repo powerai-manual-test --connect
   ```
   with `SQLFLOW_PBIX_EXTRACT` pointed at `tools/pbix-extract/build/pbix-extract`. Where it was
   `Excel.Workbook`/`Json.Document` warnings before, it should now report `sourceServer`/
   `sourceDatabase`/`sourceSchema`/`sourceName` for every resolved table, and the rendered SQL for
   each visual should carry real `[dbo].[DimReseller]`/`[dbo].[FactResellerSales]`-shaped identifiers
   once the `LineageGraphBuilder` synonym pass rewrites the model names, rather than the current
   `FROM [Sales] AS [s]`.

## What to bring back to me

The updated `.pbix` file (or its path if it's already back in this repo). I'll do the sync, confirm
the resolved `SynonymLink`s and rendered SQL for real, and update POWERAI.md Section 10's "Known
limitations" from "built but unproven" to verified, with the actual evidence.
