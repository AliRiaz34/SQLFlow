/// Expands a typed business question into the related vocabulary a stored question might have used instead, so
/// a search for "turnover" also reaches a dashboard question phrased as "revenue" (POWERAI.md Section 6). This
/// is the paraphrase gap a plain word search cannot close on its own.
/// <para>
/// The expansion covers BOTH synonymy ("turnover"/"revenue") and grammatical form ("sales"/"sells"/"sold").
/// Where SQL Server's full-text feature is installed the engine stems for us and the forms are redundant but
/// harmless; where it is absent the search falls back to literal word matching and these forms are the only
/// thing bridging "sales" to a question worded "sells". Asking for them unconditionally keeps retrieval
/// behaving the same on both kinds of instance, and covers irregulars ("sold") that no stemmer derives from
/// the root anyway.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Like <see cref="QuestionGenerator"/>, this is a plain, stateless, single-turn completion rather than an
/// <see cref="IAssistantGateway"/> consumer: it needs none of that gateway's MCP tool loop, streaming, or
/// per-user bearer. It returns TERMS rather than a ready-made query string on purpose, so the caller assembles
/// the full-text predicate itself: a model-authored fragment interpolated into search syntax is both a
/// correctness hazard (an apostrophe in "customer's" breaks the predicate) and an injection-shaped one.
